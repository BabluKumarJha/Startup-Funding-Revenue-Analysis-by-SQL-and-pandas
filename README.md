# Startup Funding & Revenue Analysis using SQL and Pandas

This project is a real-world-inspired SQL and Python-based analysis of startup data. It focuses on understanding how funding impacts a startup's survival, growth, and performance. I created this project for learning, improving SQL skills, and applying data logic on real scenarios using self-made datasets.

## 🚀 Project Objective

- Analyze startup data (founders, funding, revenue, status).
- Understand trends in funding rounds.
- Use SQL queries to solve business problems.
- Simulate real data analysis workflow (CSV creation → SQL → Insight).

## ⚙ Tools & Skills Used

- *SQL (MySQL)*: joins, aggregation, subqueries, window functions
- *Python (Pandas)*: create mock data, export to CSV
- *MySQL Workbench / DBeaver*: database and query execution

## 📊 Business Questions Solved

| Problem | Query Type |
|---------|------------|
| Count of founders by gender | Grouped count |
| Average age of founders | AVG() |
| Startups with highest revenue | MAX() + JOIN |
| Year-wise funding trends | GROUP BY, SUM() |
| Rank companies by funding | RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() |
| Which startups may struggle financially? | CASE statement |
| Shut down or acquired startups | Filters on status table |
| Lead/Lag in funding | LEAD() & LAG() window functions |
