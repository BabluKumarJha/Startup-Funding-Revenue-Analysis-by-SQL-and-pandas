Startup Funding & Revenue Analysis

This is a SQL-based analytics project where I created and analyzed a startup database using real-world inspired data. I used Python (Pandas) to create and insert data, and SQL to perform deep analysis using both basic and advanced queries.

About the Project

This project simulates a real-life scenario where we analyze startup performance based on:

Founders' profiles

Funding rounds

Revenue generation

Operational status


We answer questions like:

How does funding affect survival?

Which startups are performing better?

What kind of founders are common in profitable companies?

Skills & Tools Used

SQL: Joins, Window Functions, Subqueries, Aggregates, Case Statements

Python (Pandas): Creating and exporting CSVs for database input

MySQL: Running queries, exploring datasets

Data Modeling: Created structured relationships between startups, founders, revenue, and funding

Why This Project Matters

This project shows how data can be used to drive business decisions—like identifying which startups are likely to survive or need more support. It mimics tasks done in real data analyst or junior data science roles.
